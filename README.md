# Technical Documentation Page

This project is a responsive technical documentation page that demonstrates key concepts of responsive web design. The page includes detailed sections on essential topics such as flexible layouts, media queries, and best practices in responsive design.

## Features:

### Structure
- **Main Content**: The page's content is structured using semantic HTML elements. The main content is housed within the `main-doc` element, which contains multiple `section` elements, each representing a distinct topic.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: A `nav` element, with the ID `navbar`, provides links to navigate through the different sections. Each section in the content has a corresponding link in the sidebar for easy access.

### Design & Layout
- The page is designed using a **grid layout** with two main areas: a sidebar (`dashboard-sidebar`) and a main content area (`dashboard-main`).
- The sidebar is fixed on the left side of the screen and contains links to each section of the page, allowing for quick navigation.
- The layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS Grid and media queries. On small screens, the sidebar is hidden, and the content takes up the full width of the screen.

### Technical Details
- **HTML Structure**: 
  - The page uses semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
  - Each section within `main-doc` has an ID corresponding to its header, allowing users to navigate directly to specific sections from the sidebar.
  - Sections contain a mix of `<p>`, `<code>`, and `<ul>` elements to present the information in a clear and accessible way.
  
- **CSS Layout**: 
  - The layout uses CSS Grid to position the sidebar and main content area. The grid layout is responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes.
  - A media query is used to hide the sidebar and ensure the content area takes the full width of the screen on smaller devices (less than 768px wide).

### Responsive Features:
- **Media Queries**: At screen widths below 768px, the sidebar is hidden, and the content area spans the full width of the screen.
- **Flexible Layouts**: Sections are styled with flexible units like percentages, `em`, and `rem` to ensure they scale properly across various devices.
- **Flexible Images**: Images are set to scale proportionally within their containers using `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto;`.

### Navigation:
- Clicking a link in the sidebar navigates to the corresponding section within the main content area. For example, clicking on the "What is Responsive Design" link in the sidebar scrolls the page to the section with the ID `what_is_responsive_design`.
